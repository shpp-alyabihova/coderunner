CodeRunner is an open-source project, that allows people to compile and test their code at the remote server.
All you need is to request server to compile your code (or not to compile, if you have interpretive code) and run program throught a variety of user-defined test cases. Generally, your request will lok like:
> Hello, CodeRunner!<br>
>I'm John and I want you to test my C++ code<br>
>Here is some code to test<br>
>And here are some test cases i prepared previously

Every user-code compilation and execution process is enclosed to isolated docker container.
